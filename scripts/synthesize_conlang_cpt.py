"""Generate a CPT corpus in a ConlangCrafter-produced constructed language.

One-shot pipeline:
1. Pull a language spec from `malper/ConlangCrafter` (HF).
2. Stream-generate fresh prose via Gemini on Vertex AI, using the spec as
   system instructions and rotating topic seeds for diversity.
3. Lexicon-overlap quality gate per chunk; retry up to 2x then discard.
4. Append-only JSONL output during the run so a Ctrl-C is resumable.
5. At the end, convert JSONL to a single parquet and write the spec alongside.

Push to the Hub with `scripts/push_conlang_dataset.py` afterwards.
